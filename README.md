# Disco Inferno format

## What is Disco Inferno?

Disco inferno is an alternate format for Yu-Gi-Oh. It changes slightly every first of the month, and you can always find the latest banlist [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-U6SXZt7FY52GzoC8KNNx8pjdh0H91dA/view?usp=sharing).

Every time a new banlist is created, we check TCGPlayer for prices for every single Yu-Gi-Oh card. Those that are cheaper than $0.50 become legal for the next month. We use the TCG Advanced banlist otherwise.

In the case that a TCG banlist drops, a new one will be generated for the remainder of the month.

In addition to this, some additional cards have been forbidden (regardless of price, some of these might already be illegal due to price constraints when a new banlist gets generated) to ensure a good experience. Additional cards might and probably will get hit in the future. We will strive to keep this list as small as possible, but we really want to keep FTKs, infinite loops and summon-restricting floodgates to a minimum.
