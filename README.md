# Disco Inferno format

## What is Disco Inferno?

[Disco Inferno](https://diamonddudetcg.github.io/Disco-Inferno/) is an alternate format for Yu-Gi-Oh. It changes slightly every first of the month, and you can always find the latest banlist [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-U6SXZt7FY52GzoC8KNNx8pjdh0H91dA/view?usp=sharing).

Every time a new banlist is created, we check TCGPlayer for prices for every single Yu-Gi-Oh card. Those that are cheaper than $0.50 become legal for the next month. We use the TCG Advanced banlist otherwise.

In the case that a TCG banlist drops, a new one will be generated for the remainder of the month.

## Custom banlist

In addition to all of these stipulations, we have decided to make some additional changes to the banlist because a lot of the advanced hits do not make sense without access to some expensive cards, and some cards are kind of overpowered when you remove some checks and balances Advanced has. The full banlist can be found in our Discord server.

## How to install the banlist:
Just drop the DiscoInferno.lflist.conf file into ProjectIgnis/lflists, close any instances of EDOPRO and open a new one.
