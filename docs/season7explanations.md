## Disco Inferno Season 7 Banlist explanations:


You know the drill.

<br>

## Forbidden

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Consecrated Light](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Consecrated%20Light)
<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Performapal%20Five-Rainbow%20Magician)

We're adding more floodgates to the list of banned floodgates.

<img src="assets/fusion.png" alt="Fusion Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Grapha,%20Dragon%20Overlord%20of%20Dark%20World)

Dark World was the most powerful deck last season, and a big chunk of its power was concentrated in this one card.  

<img src="assets/link.png" alt="Link Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Guardragon Elpy](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Guardragon%20Elpy)

With the last reprint of Spheres, Dragon Link would very likely get very over the top.

<img src="assets/trap.png" alt="Trap" width="12" height="12"/> [Deck Devastation Virus](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Deck%20Devastation%20Virus)

<img src="assets/trap.png" alt="Trap" width="12" height="12"/> [Full Force Virus](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Full%20Force%20Virus)

Just as Eradicator before it, these have proven to be way too powerful and uninteractive.

## Limited

<img src="assets/synchro.png" alt="Synchro Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Blackwing Full Armor Master](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blackwing%20Full%20Armor%20Master)

Playing against multiple Full Armor Masters was probably the most frustrating experience this format has ever dealt with. Dealing with just 1 was easy, it was the second one that felt like agony. We want Blackwing to be a part of the format, so this feels like a better compromise than hitting Simoon or Black Whirlwind. 

<br>

## Semi-Limited

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [The Gates of Dark World](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=The%20Gates%20of%20Dark%20World)

While we don't usually do consistency hits, hitting Gates also significantly lowers the ceiling of the deck since you usually go through all 3 copies on turn 1.

## Unlimited

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Resonance Insect](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Resonance%20Insect)

<img src="assets/link.png" alt="Link Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Sky Striker Ace - Kagari](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Sky%20Striker%20Ace%20-%20Kagari)

We promised it last season

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Majespecter Unicorn - Kirin](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Majespecter%20Unicorn%20-%20Kirin)

Pend isn't doing anything. We ball.

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [SPYRAL Master Plan](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=SPYRAL%20Master%20Plan)

The second we get Double Helix or Magician's Souls she goes back to 0, but it was requested and it's probably okay.

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Jewels of the Valiant](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Jewels%20Of%20The%20Valiant)

Tenyi lost too much between rotation and bans. This can come back.

<img src="assets/vanilla.png" alt="Normal Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Mystical Shine Ball](https://db.ygpprodeck.com/card/?search=Mystical%20Shine%20Ball)

Agents haven't done anything with 2 balls, probably due to losing some pieces in rotation. Instead of completely curbstomping every single combo deck in the format, we're hoping to reach an equilibrium where multiple combo decks can function at the same time.
