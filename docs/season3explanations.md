## Disco Inferno Season 3 Banlist explanations:


Starting with Season 3, we're doing something Konami hasn't done since 2012 and we're explaining the banlist movements.

The purpose of this banlist is hitting the unfair parts of certain decks that are perfectly fine to exist, but also to hopefully remove Floowandereeze from the format, whose resource loop is incredibly good in a format with a smaller card pool than Advanced, and whose weakness to hand traps is largely removed in a format in which the only legal one is [Ghost Mourner](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ghost%20Mourner%20%26%20Moonlit%20Chill).


## Forbidden


<br>

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Dragon Buster Destruction Sword](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dragon%20Buster%20Destruction%20Sword)

As always, extra deck locking isn't okay in this format and we'll ban every card that does that.


<img src="assets/synchro.png" alt="Synchro Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [T.G. Hyper Librarian](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=T.G.%20Hyper%20Librarian)

Synchron was abusing this to no end making boards the format isn't really equipped to beat. Rather than outright kill Synchron as a deck, we've decided to remove its ability to draw hand traps and extenders while going off. We expect this to lower the ceiling of the deck without making it unplayable.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Performapal Popperup](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Performapal%20Popperup)

This card was being abused by a deep draw Exodia deck. Without [Ash Blossom](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ash%20Blossom%20%26%20Joyous%20Spring) to heavily punish it, Popperup is just a bit too good.


<img src="assets/trap.png" alt="Trap" width="12" height="12"/> [Royal Decree](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Royal%20Decree)

With no floodgates left in the format, this card is acting as a gatekeeper for trap-based decks to succeed. We want those to be viable in the format, so we're banning Royal Decree.


## Limited


<br>

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Floowandereeze & Eglen](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20%26%20Eglen)

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Floowandereeze & Robina](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20%26%20Robina)

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20and%20the%20Magnificent%20Map)

Hits 4, 5 and 6 to Floowandereeze. It was one of the best decks (if not the single best) last season, and we just don't want them in the format. We've had enough of them in Advanced, and them getting Map in addition to everything they already had was a recipe for a tier 0 format, and the only thing worse than a tier 0 format is one where the deck is both massively unfun to play against and has a terrible and very confusing mirror match. We just don't want Floowandereeze to be a top tier deck.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Majespecter Unicorn - Kirin](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Majespecter%20Unicorn%20-%20Kirin)

Pendulum has been very underwhelming since the conception of the format, so we're throwing it another bone. Kirin is a very strong card, but we hope it will be a good payoff for Pendulum decks.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [SPYRAL Master Plan](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=SPYRAL%20Master%20Plan)

With no access to [Double Helix](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=SPYRAL%20Double%20Helix) or [Magicians' Souls](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Magicians'%20Souls), we expect this to do nothing to the format. It was heavily requested by some players so we decided to let them have fun with it. 


<img src="assets/link.png" alt="Link Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Guardragon Elpy](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Guardragon%20Elpy)

Like Pendulum, Dragons have had a lot of tools at their disposal that somehow haven't crystalized into a competitive deck. We banned the Amorphage monsters so no extra deck locks are possible with this, but we hope giving them access to a searchable [Omni Dragon Brotaur](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Omni%20Dragon%20Brotaur) (and in turn, making [Levianeer](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Chaos%20Dragon%20Levianeer) searchable) will make Dragons strong enough to compete.


## Unlimited


<br>

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Exodia the Forbidden One](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Exodia%20the%20Forbidden%20One)

<img src="assets/vanilla.png" alt="Normal Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Left Leg of the Forbidden One](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Left%20Leg%20of%20the%20Forbidden%20One)

<img src="assets/vanilla.png" alt="Normal Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Left Arm of the Forbidden One](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Left%20Arm%20of%20the%20Forbidden%20One)

<img src="assets/vanilla.png" alt="Normal Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Right Arm of the Forbidden One](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Right%20Arm%20of%20the%20Forbidden%20One)

<img src="assets/vanilla.png" alt="Normal Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Right Leg of the Forbidden One](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Right%20Leg%20of%20the%20Forbidden%20One)

These are harmless, there's always a piece that is illegal and even if it weren't, you probably wouldn't want to run more than 1 of each.

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Cyber Jar](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Cyber%20Jar)

Konami thinks it's fine at 1, we think it's fine at 3. We have had Morphing Jar legal at 3 for two formats and it has done nothing. Bring it on.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Megalith Unformed](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Megalith%20Unformed)

This was an overreaction from Season 2. The finals of <b>DICC 1</b> was a Megalith Drytron mirror match so we wanted to hit the deck somehow. Turns out the problem was [Amorphactor Pain](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Amorphactor%20Pain,%20the%20Imagination%20Dracoverlord) all along, and banning it pretty much killed the deck, so Unformed can come back.
