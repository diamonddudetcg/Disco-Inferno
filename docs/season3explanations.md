## Disco Inferno Season 3 Banlist explanations:


Starting with Season 3, we're doing something Konami hasn't done since 2012 and we're explaining the banlist movements.


## Forbidden

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Denko Sekka](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Denko%20Sekka)

Decks that don't need their Normal Summon have abused this card to beat backrow decks. We want control decks to be able to flip Trap cards, so we've decided to ban Denko Sekka to make the format a little less hostile to them.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Dimension Shifter](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dimension%20Shifter)

The reprint in the Crystal Beast structure deck makes this cheap enough to impact our format. This is a massively unfun card that almost always translates to turn skips, and this format prides itself in being interactive. We don't even want to see what this card does to the format, so we are pre-emptively banning it.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Scary Moth](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Scary%20Moth)

Scary Moth is just a searchable Winda that Beetrooper was abusing by reviving it with [Number 3: Cicada King](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Number%203:%20Cicada%20King). We think the Beetrooper core is fine in the format, but we are hitting the two most unfair endboard pieces to make it easier to deal with it. The deck is still alive and kicking and we expect it to be a huge competitor in Disco Inferno going forward, but it will be less reliant on floodgates now.


<img src="assets/fusion.png" alt="XYZ Fusion" width="12" height="12"/> [Invoked Caliga](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Invoked%20Caliga)

With Tearlaments joining the format, making Caliga was as easy as fusing any Tear name + King of the Swamp. The Tearlaments engine has proven to be mostly fine unless this exact card was summoned.


<img src="assets/synchro.png" alt="Synchro Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Herald of the Arc Light](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Herald%20of%20the%20Arc%20Light)

Herald of the Arc Light was only legal because someone listed OCG copies on Cardmarket. It's a $2 card otherwise. Additionally, it made Megalith Drytron way better because they could use Extra Foolish Burial as a consistency tool.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Gold Sarcophagus](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Gold%20Sarcophagus)

Our bad. We didn't expect Floowandereeze to be reprinted to the point where every card was legal.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Mystic Mine](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mystic%20Mine)

We don't expect this to be cheap anytime soon, but we wanted to make a statement.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Set Rotation](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Set%20Rotation)

Our bad. We didn't expect this to be used as a counter to decks that require a Field Spell to function. 


<img src="assets/trap.png" alt="Trap" width="12" height="12"/> [Eradicator Epidemic Virus](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Eradicator%20Epidemic%20Virus)

All my homies hate lingering floodgates that also give perfect hand knowledge


<img src="assets/trap.png" alt="Trap" width="12" height="12"/> [Give and Take](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Give%20and%20Take)

Probably the funniest one, Beetrooper was using this to give their opponents a [Beetrooper Scout Buggy](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Beetrooper%20Scout%20Buggy) and lock them from special summoning anything but Insects. The Insect pile is fine, floodgates are not.


## Limited

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Floowandereeze & Eglen](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20%26%20Eglen)

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Floowandereeze & Robina](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20%26%20Robina)

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20and%20the%20Magnificent%20Map)

Floowandereeze was one of the best decks last format, and we just don't want them in the format. We've had enough of them in Advanced, and them getting Map in addition to everything they already had was a recipe for a tier 0 format, and the only thing worse than a tier 0 format is one where the deck is both massively unfun to play against and has a terrible and very confusing mirror match. We just don't want Floowandereeze to be a top tier deck.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Majespecter Unicorn - Kirin](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Majespecter%20Unicorn%20-%20Kirin)

Pendulum has been very underwhelming since the conception of the format, so we're throwing it another bone. Kirin is a very strong card, but we hope it will be a good payoff for Pendulum decks.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [SPYRAL Master Plan](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=SPYRAL%20Master%20Plan)

With no access to Double Helix or Magicians' Souls, we expect this to do nothing to the format. It was heavily requested by some players so we decided to let them have fun with it. 


<img src="assets/link.png" alt="Link Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Guardragon Elpy](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Guardragon%20Elpy)

Like Pendulum, Dragons have had a lot of tools at their disposal that somehow haven't crystalized into a competitive deck. We banned the Amorphage monsters so no extra deck locks are possible with this, but we hope giving them access to a searchable Omni Dragon Brotaur (and in turn, making Levianeer searchable) will make Dragons strong enough to compete.


## Unlimited

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Megalith Unformed](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Megalith%20Unformed)

This was an overreaction from Season 2. The finals was a Megalith Drytron mirror match so we wanted to hit the deck somehow. Turns out the problem was Amorphactor Pain all along, and banning it pretty much killed the deck, so Unformed can come back.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Cyber Jar](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Cyber%20Jar)

Konami thinks it's fine at 1, we think it's fine at 3. We have had Morphing Jar legal at 3 for two formats and it has done nothing. Bring it on.
