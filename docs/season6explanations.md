## Disco Inferno Season 5 Banlist explanations:


You know the drill.


## Forbidden

Tenyi Swordsoul was undoubtedly the best deck in the format, and Longyuan was the lynchpin of the archetype. Without it, access to powerful LV10 synchro plays is closed, and the power level hopefully will get more in line with the rest of Disco Inferno.

## Limited

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Danger! Chupacabra!](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Danger!%20Chupacabra!")


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Danger! Thunderbird!](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Danger!%20Thunderbird!")


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Danger! Mothman!](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Danger!%20Mothman!")

With the release of the Dark World structure deck, Dark World is poised to be a very frustrating top deck. Limiting the most powerful Dangers will hopefully make it easier to deal with.

<img src="assets/synchro.png" alt="Synchro Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Virtual%20World%20Kyubi%20-%20Shenshen)

Virtual World has been legal in multiple formats and it's done pretty much nothing. Although Shenshen is a crazy powerful card in low powered environments, we're going to test it at 1 to see how it performs.

<br>

## Semi-Limited

<img src="assets/link.png" alt="Link Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Sky Striker Ace - Kagari](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Sky%20Striker%20Ace%20-%20Kagari)

Sky Striker hasn't done anything even after MAMA. Out of an abundance of caution we're not instantly unlimiting Kagari, but if SS does nothing next season, she'll probably become unlimited.
