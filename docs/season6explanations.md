## Disco Inferno Season 5 Banlist explanations:


You know the drill.


## Forbidden

Tenyi Swordsoul was undoubtedly the best deck in the format, and Longyuan was the lynchpin of the archetype. Without it, access to powerful LV10 synchro plays is closed, and the power level hopefully will get more in line with the rest of Disco Inferno.

Essentially the Predaplant 1 card combo, Instant Fusion generates way too much advantage by itself to be allowed in the format.
