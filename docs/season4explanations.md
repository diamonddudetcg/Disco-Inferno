## Disco Inferno Season 4 Banlist explanations:


You know the drill.


## Forbidden


<br>

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Dragon Buster Destruction Sword](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dragon%20Buster%20Destruction%20Sword)

As always, extra deck locking isn't okay in this format and we'll ban every card that does that.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Majesty's Fiend](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Majesty's%20Fiend)

Turns out we missed this one.


<img src="assets/fusion.png" alt="XYZ Fusion" width="12" height="12"/> [Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Lyrilusc%20-%20Independent%20Nightingale)

We are banning this to make sure bringing two other cards back doesn't result in FTKs, not as a hit to Lyrilusc since they don't even play this card.


<img src="assets/synchro.png" alt="Synchro Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [T.G. Hyper Librarian](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=T.G.%20Hyper%20Librarian)

Synchron was abusing this to no end making boards the format isn't really equipped to beat. Rather than outright kill Synchron as a deck, we've decided to remove its ability to draw hand traps and extenders while going off. We expect this to lower the ceiling of the deck without making it unplayable.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Performapal Popperup](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Performapal%20Popperup)

This card was being abused by a deep draw Exodia deck. Without [Ash Blossom](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ash%20Blossom%20%26%20Joyous%20Spring) to heavily punish it, Popperup is just a bit too good.


<img src="assets/trap.png" alt="Trap" width="12" height="12"/> [Royal Decree](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Royal%20Decree)

With no floodgates left in the format, this card is acting as a gatekeeper for trap-based decks to succeed. We want those to be viable in the format, so we're banning Royal Decree.


## Limited


<br>

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Resonance Insect](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Resonance%20Insect)

Resonance Insect was the lynchpin of the Insect pile. Limiting it directly eliminates the possibility of high roll hands where you get two searches instead of just the one the default combo goes for, which means [Mighty Neptune](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Heavy%20Beetrooper%20Mighty%20Neptune) is less accessible (which makes recycling Resonance Insect harder), and makes it so there is no line where you can't end on two negates.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Emergency Teleport](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20and%20the%20Magnificent%20Map)

Teleport was being abused in both Synchron and Virtual World. The fact it's an extender that doubles up as interruption due to [Ghost Ogre](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card?search=Ghost%20ogre%20%26%20Snow%20Rabbit) is what put this card over the top.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Hey, Trunade!](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Hey,%20Trunade!)

With both [Denko Sekka](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Denko%20Sekka) and [Royal Decree](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Royal%20Decree) gone, we wanted to have a card that punishes backrow decks without outright killing them. We are testing the waters with it as Hey proved to be a very toxic card at 3, but we are hopeful that it'll be okay at 1. It also incentivizes trap decks to play defensive options like [Threatening Roar](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Threatening%20Roar) or [Waboku](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Waboku), and you can always have more of those than your opponent has Hey.

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Jewels of the Valiant](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Jewels%20of%20the%20Valiant)

Jewels of the Valiant gives Tenyi a way better grind game than it would normally have. We want Tenyi to still be a deck, so this is mostly a slap in the wrist.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Interrupted Kaiju Slumber](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Floowandereeze%20and%20the%20Magnificent%20Map)

With how prevalent Kaijus are in Disco Inferno, Slumber had become both a facilitator for two card OTKs with [Fallen of Albaz](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card?search=Fallen%20of%20Albaz) and just a better version of [Dark Hole](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card?search=Dark%20Hole) that had very little opportunity cost. We want boardbreakers to be in the format, but this one was doing a bit too much.


## Unlimited

<img src="assets/xyz.png" alt="XYZ Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Wind-Up Carrier Zenmaity"](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Wind-Up%20Carrier%20Zenmaity)

We don't think any of these are going to break anything.

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [True King Lithosagym, the Disaster](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=True%20King%20Lithosagym,%20The%20Disaster)

<img src="assets/fusion.png" alt="Fusion Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Supreme%20King%20Dragon%20Starving%20Venom)

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Tempest,%20Dragon%20Ruler%20of%20Storms")

Dinosaurs, Pendulum and Dragons haven't performed at all, and we want to gradually give them stuff until they become playable. If something breaks we'll consider changing stuff back, but these feel safe enough.
