## Disco Inferno Season 5 Banlist explanations:


You know the drill.


## Forbidden

<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Jowgen the Spiritualist](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Jowgen%20the%20Spiritualist)

Can't believe you guys keep on finding ways to make floodgates happen.

## Limited


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Performapal Monkeyboard](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Performapal%20Monkeyboard)

We unlimited this expecting Pendulum decks to use it as an easier way to set up scales, not for non-pendulum decks to use it as an enabler to pendulum summon once and then get an Upstart Goblin.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Tempest,%20Dragon%20Ruler%20of%20Storms")

When we decided to put Tempest to 3, we didn't expect every other Dragon Ruler to become legal overnight. The idea was for Dragons to have access to more extenders, not to allow people to just play 7 rulers in a deck.

<img src="assets/link.png" alt="Link Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Sky Striker Ace - Kagari](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Sky%20Striker%20Ace%20-%20Kagari)

With Magnificent Mavens, Sky Striker is almost at full power. Kagari to 1 should help mitigate the power of the deck so it doesn't eat up everything. If the deck does nothing with Kagari at 1, we'll reconsider this.

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Gold Sarcophagus](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Gold%20Sarcophagus)

Gold Sarcophagus was hit as a Floowandereeze hit but with no Floowandereeze in the horizon, it feels like it can come back to 1.

## Semi-Limited

<img src="assets/vanilla.png" alt="Normal Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Mystical Shine Ball](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mystical%20Shine%20Ball)

A slap in the wrist to Agents. The idea was a hit that would significantly lower the ceiling of the deck without harming the consistency. Shine Ball to 2 means you get 2-3 less bodies over the course of a turn. We're not big fans of the Semi-Limited list, but limiting Shine Ball makes the deck unplayable, and leaving it at 3 was too powerful for the format.

## Unlimited


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Ronintoadin](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ronintoadin")

With no Spright cards and the rest of the engine too expensive for the format, there's no reason for Ronin not to be at 3.


<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Numeron Calling](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Numeron%20Calling)

Due to popular demand we're bringing this back, but this could very well break the format and if it does we're banning it again.

<img src="assets/spell.png" alt="Spell" width="12" height="12"/> [Performapal Popperup](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Performapal%20Popperup)

Same as Numeron Calling. If this starts to see widespread play we're banning it again.
