## Limited

We unlimited this expecting Pendulum decks to use it as an easier way to set up scales, not for non-pendulum decks to use it as an enabler to pendulum summon once and then get an Upstart Goblin.


<img src="assets/effect.png" alt="Effect Monster" width="12" height="12"/> [Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Tempest,%20Dragon%20Ruler%20of%20Storms")

When we decided to put Tempest to 3, we didn't expect every other Dragon Ruler to become legal overnight. The idea was for Dragons to have access to more extenders, not to allow people to just play 7 rulers in a deck.
