When we decided to put Tempest to 3, we didn't expect every other Dragon Ruler to become legal overnight. The idea was for Dragons to have access to more extenders, not to allow people to just play 7 rulers in a deck. We aren't really limiting Tempest, but undoing the change and letting it revert to the TCG banlist.
