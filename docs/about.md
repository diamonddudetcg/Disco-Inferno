## What is Disco Inferno?

Disco Inferno is a budget-oriented, online only alt format that rotates once a month.

It is loosely based on the MTG fanmade format [Penny Dreadful](http://www.pennydreadfulmagic.com)

Since we don't have something like Magic Online that allows really good cards to be insanely cheap and have to rely on both TCGPlayer and Cardmarket prices, we had to settle for a higher price point than they do. After a lot of tinkering, we settled for $0.50 as the cutoff point. This means, everything that is $0.50 or cheaper when the banlist is generated will remain legal until the next banlist.

There are two instances where a banlist will be generated:

* A new official TCG banlist is released
* The first day of a month

The monthly banlists will only be generated if no official banlist has dropped a week before the first day of a month.

Strictly delimitated banlists are something other budget formats did not have, and they allow for a clear cut definition of what is legal and what isn't. While they leave less flexibility to the deckbuilder, they make tournaments easier to organize.

## Custom banlist

In addition to all of these stipulations, we have decided to make some additional changes to the banlist because a lot of the advanced hits do not make sense without access to some expensive cards, and some cards are kind of overpowered when you remove some checks and balances Advanced has. The full banlist can be found [here](legality).
