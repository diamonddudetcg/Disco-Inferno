## What is Disco Inferno?

Disco Inferno is a budget-oriented, online only alt format that rotates with every set release.

It is loosely based on the MTG fanmade format [Penny Dreadful](http://www.pennydreadfulmagic.com)

Since we don't have something like Magic Online that allows really good cards to be insanely cheap and have to rely on the sources we do have (TCGPlayer, Cardmarket, Coolstuffinc, Amazon and eBay), we had to settle for a higher price point than they do. After a lot of tinkering, we settled for $0.50 as the cutoff point. This means, everything that is $0.50 or cheaper when the banlist is generated will remain legal until the next banlist.

Prices are determined as the cheapest of the 5 sources we have, but we consider Cardmarket and TCGPlayer the two most reliable sources, so if any of the other three return absurd prices, the algorithm discards those (a price is considered to be absurd if it's exactly 0 or it's at least 3 times cheaper than those from the reliable sources).

There are two instances where a banlist will be generated:

* A week after the release of a major set (Everything except Speed Duel product, OTS packs and Structure Decks)
* The first day of a month

The monthly banlists will only be generated if no official banlist has dropped a week before the first day of a month.

On average, formats tend to last 2-3 weeks, so if something is broken it will get dealt with pretty quickly.

Strictly delimitated banlists are something other budget formats did not have, and they allow for a clear cut definition of what is legal and what isn't. While they leave less flexibility to the deckbuilder, they make tournaments easier to organize.

## Custom banlist

In addition to all of these stipulations, we have decided to make some additional changes to the banlist because a lot of the advanced hits do not make sense without access to some expensive cards, and some cards are kind of overpowered when you remove some checks and balances Advanced has. The full banlist can be found [here](legality).
