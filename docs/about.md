## What is Disco Inferno?

Disco Inferno is a budget-oriented, online only alt format that rotates once a month.

It is loosely based on the MTG fanmade format [Penny Dreadful](http://www.pennydreadfulmagic.com)

Since we don't have something like Magic Online that allows really good cards to be insanely cheap and have to rely on TCGPlayer prices, we had to settle for a higher price point than they do. After a lot of tinkering, we settled for $0.50 as the cutoff point. This means, everything that is $0.50 or cheaper when the banlist is generated will remain legal until the next banlist.

There are three instances where a banlist will be generated:

* A new official TCG banlist is released
* A new TCG product is released
* The first day of a month (only if no banlist has been generated in at least a week)

The monthly cutoff points are something other budget formats did not have, and they allow for a clear cut definition of what is legal and what isn't. While they leave less flexibility to the deckbuilder, they make tournaments easier to organize.

## Custom banlist

In addition to all of these stipulations, there are a couple of cards that, if left unchecked, would either run with every format they are legal in, or would make the experience really unfun, so we decided to add a small banlist to make the format more fun to play and brew.

The banlist as it currently stands is as follows:

| Card Name | Status |
| :-- | :-- |
| Amazoness Archer | Forbidden |
| Artifact Scythe | Forbidden |
| Cannon Soldier | Forbidden |
| Cannon Soldier MK-2 | Forbidden |
| Fairy Tail - Snow | Forbidden |
| Morphtronic Telefon | Forbidden |
| Toon Cannon Soldier | Forbidden |
| Gouki the Powerload Ogre | Forbidden |
| Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech | Forbidden |
| Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity | Forbidden |
| Numeron Calling | Forbidden |
| Anti-Spell Fragrance | Forbidden |
| Dimensional Barrier | Forbidden |
| Gozen Match | Forbidden |
| Harpie's Feather Storm | Forbidden |
| Rivalry of Warlords | Forbidden |
| Summon Limit | Forbidden |
| There Can Be Only One | Forbidden |
