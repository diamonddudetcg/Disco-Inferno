## What is Disco Inferno?

Disco Inferno is a budget-oriented, online only alt format that rotates once a month.

It is loosely based on the MTG fanmade format [Penny Dreadful](http://www.pennydreadfulmagic.com)

Since we don't have something like Magic Online that allows really good cards to be insanely cheap and have to rely on TCGPlayer prices, we had to settle for a higher price point than they do. After a lot of tinkering, we settled for $0.50 as the cutoff point. This means, everything that is $0.50 or cheaper when the banlist is generated will remain legal until the next banlist.

There are three instances where a banlist will be generated:

* A new official TCG banlist is released
* A week after a new TCG product is released (to allow the market to stabilize)
* The first day of a month

The monthly banlists will only be generated if no official banlist has dropped a week before the first day of a month and no product release banlist is scheduled to be released before the 7th of that month.

Strictly delimitated banlists are something other budget formats did not have, and they allow for a clear cut definition of what is legal and what isn't. While they leave less flexibility to the deckbuilder, they make tournaments easier to organize.

## Custom banlist

In addition to all of these stipulations, there are a couple of cards that, if left unchecked, would either run with every format they are legal in, or would make the experience really unfun, so we decided to add a small banlist to make the format more fun to play and brew.

The banlist as it currently stands is as follows:

| Card Name | Status |
| :-- | :-- |
| Amazoness Archer | Forbidden |
| Artifact Scythe | Forbidden |
| Cannon Soldier | Forbidden |
| Cannon Soldier MK-2 | Forbidden |
| Fairy Tail - Snow | Forbidden |

| Dimensional Barrier | Forbidden |
| Gozen Match | Forbidden |
| Harpie's Feather Storm | Forbidden |
| Rivalry of Warlords | Forbidden |
| Summon Limit | Forbidden |
